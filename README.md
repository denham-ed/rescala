The User Stories for this project were planned and tracked  using [GitHub's Projects Tool.](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects "Link to information on GitHub Projects")

User Stories were categories into Epics and broken down into tasks with clear acceptance criteria. The user stories can be viewd, in full, [here.](https://github.com/users/denham-ed/projects/6 "Link to Rescala User Stories")
